# Live Age - Chrome Extension

I badly wanted a reminder that time flies and to make good use of the time. I thought many ways of getting this done. Finally, ended up building a New Tab extension for chrome which displays me my live age. It keeps incrementing for every second.

### Steps to install

- Clone the repo
- Enable developer mode in Chrome Extensions
- Import this folder
